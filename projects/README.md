# ðŸ’» Projects

This folder contains all the software development projects I've worked on while learning and growing as a developer.

## ðŸ§© Structure

Each project resides in its own folder with:
- `README.md` â€“ Project description, usage, and installation instructions.
- `main.cpp` or equivalent â€“ Source code.
- Additional files (docs, assets, configs, etc.)

## âœ… Goals

- Learn and apply C++ and other technologies
- Build useful and potentially monetizable tools
- Document progress and share publicly
